# Scripts for running additional annotation with blastp


### Comment: 
Currently these are not organized. The general procedure is blastp unknown "hypothetical" proteins and see what the blastp results turn up. Parsing scripts were developed by Leonardo Tresoldi Goncalve (Moontooth Lab). 

Message me if you have questions, unless I get around to updating the documentation.
