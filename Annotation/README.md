# A Genome Assembly and Annotation Workflow 
#### Authored: Michael Grapin -- Moore Lab Research Technician @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln 

## Purpose of the Repository: 
This repository is meant to provide others out there with informative guide to genome assembly and annotation. This is no means exhuastive but a starting point based on my learned experience. 

## Outline: 
* Annotation
	* Annotating Our Genome
		- The Goal of Annotation
	* Repeat Masking
		- [RepeatModeler](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler) 
		- [RepeatMasker](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatMasker) 
		- Using the[Dfam](https://www.dfam.org/home) database
		- Machine Learning to Classify Transposable Elements
