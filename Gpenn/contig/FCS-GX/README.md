# Note to self 
* Blob tools filtering (keeping arthopods + no blast hits) made 3208 contigs 
* FCS-GX filtering retained 3175 sequences 

**I have decieded to use blobtools filtering**

- Reason:Keeps it consitent with Gfirm and I will run FCS-GX at the end to interpert any remaining contaminants and see where they are placed
