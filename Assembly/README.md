# A Genome Assembly and Annotation Workflow 
#### Authored: Michael Grapin -- Moore Lab Research Technician @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln 

## Purpose of the Repository: 
This repository is meant to provide others out there with informative guide to genome assembly and annotation. This is no means exhuastive but a starting point based on my learned experience. 

## Outline:
* Assembly
	* Geneome Assembly
		- Using Hifiasm
		- [Hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm)
		- Script: Hifiasm.sh
	* So You Generated An Assembly
		- Quality Assessment 
			- BUSCO 
			- Merqury 
			- Quast 
			- Blobtools 
		- What Are N and L stats? 
			- N stats 
			- L stats
	* Removing Contamination
		-[Blobtools](https://github.com/genomehubs/blobtoolkit)
		- Script: Blobools.sh
	* Long Read Scaffolding
		-[Longstictch Pipeline](https://github.com/bcgsc/LongStitch)
		- Script: Longstitch.sh 
	* Gap Closing with Long Reads
		- [YAGCloser](https://github.com/merlyescalona/yagcloser)
		- Script: YAGcloser.sh
	* Some More Quality Assessment
		- Personal Observations
